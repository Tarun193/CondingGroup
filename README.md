# Discord Clone Application/Group discussion App.

## Description:

Developed a Discord-inspired group discussion platform using Django, demonstrating practical knowledge in server-side application development. Key features include the integration of Django's MVT model for linking views and URLs to Python functions, utilization of Django's template engine for various operations including CRUD operations, and management of static files and user-uploaded images. The project included exploration of various relationship models, usage of ORM for creating model-based forms, incorporation of flashing messages for user interaction. Implemented user authentication through a custom model developed by extending Django's built-in user model, improving user registration and authentication. The project highlighted my proficiency in Django and deepened my understanding of robust server-side application development.
